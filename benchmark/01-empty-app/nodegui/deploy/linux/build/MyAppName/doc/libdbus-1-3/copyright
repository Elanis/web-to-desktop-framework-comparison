Comment:
 The Tcl license appears to be compatible with either the GPL-2+
 or the AFL-2.1, so the effective license is "GPL-2+ or AFL-2.1".

 The Academic Free License
 v. 2.1
 .
 This Academic Free License (the "License") applies to any original
 work of authorship (the "Original Work") whose owner (the "Licensor")
 has placed the following notice immediately following the copyright
 notice for the Original Work:
 .
 Licensed under the Academic Free License version 2.1
 .
 1) Grant of Copyright License. Licensor hereby grants You a
 world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable
 license to do the following:
 .
 a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies;
 .
 b) to prepare derivative works ("Derivative Works") based upon the
 Original Work;
 .
 c) to distribute copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to
 the public;
 .
 d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and
 .
 e) to display the Original Work publicly.
 .
 2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide,
 royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license, under
 patent claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in
 the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, to make, use, sell and
 offer for sale the Original Work and Derivative Works.
 .
 3) Grant of Source Code License. The term "Source Code" means the
 preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and
 all available documentation describing how to modify the Original
 Work. Licensor hereby agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the
 Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original
 Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy
 this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code
 in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit
 inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as Licensor
 continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing the
 address of that information repository in a notice immediately
 following the copyright notice that applies to the Original Work.
 .
 4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor
 the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their
 trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote
 products derived from this Original Work without express prior written
 permission of the Licensor. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to
 grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or
 any other intellectual property of Licensor except as expressly stated
 herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or offer to
 sell embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims
 defined in Section 2. No right is granted to the trademarks of
 Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing
 in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from
 licensing under different terms from this License any Original Work
 that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.
 .
 5) This section intentionally omitted.
 .
 6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any
 Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark
 notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any
 notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an
 "Attribution Notice." You must cause the Source Code for any
 Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution
 Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have
 modified the Original Work.
 .
 7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor
 warrants that the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent
 rights granted herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are
 sublicensed to You under the terms of this License with the permission
 of the contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent rights. Except as
 expressly stated in the immediately proceeding sentence, the Original
 Work is provided under this License on an "AS IS" BASIS and WITHOUT
 WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation,
 the warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A
 PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL
 WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential
 part of this License. No license to Original Work is granted hereunder
 except under this disclaimer.
 .
 8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal
 theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or
 otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to any person for any direct,
 indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
 character arising as a result of this License or the use of the
 Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of
 goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and
 all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability
 shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting
 from Licensor's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such
 limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or
 limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion
 and limitation may not apply to You.
 .
 9) Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the
 Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort
 under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to
 the terms of this License. Nothing else but this License (or another
 written agreement between Licensor and You) grants You permission to
 create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work or to exercise
 any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt to do
 so except under the terms of this License (or another written
 agreement between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by
 U.S. copyright law, the equivalent laws of other countries, and by
 international treaty. Therefore, by exercising any of the rights
 granted to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate Your acceptance of
 this License and all of its terms and conditions.
 .
 10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate
 automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted
 to You by this License as of the date You commence an action,
 including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any
 licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a patent. This
 termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging patent
 infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software
 or hardware.
 .
 11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating
 to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction
 wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary
 business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its
 conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations
 Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is
 expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of
 this License or after its termination shall be subject to the
 requirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. Â§ 101
 et seq., the equivalent laws of other countries, and international
 treaty. This section shall survive the termination of this License.
 .
 12) Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License
 or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be
 entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without
 limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in
 connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. This
 section shall survive the termination of this License.
 .
 13) Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement
 concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License
 is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to
 the extent necessary to make it enforceable.
 .
 14) Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this
 License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a
 legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the
 terms of, this License. For legal entities, "You" includes any entity
 that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with
 you. For purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power,
 direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such
 entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty
 percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial
 ownership of such entity.
 .
 15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not
 otherwise restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and
 Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such
 uses by You.
 .
 This license is Copyright (C) 2003-2004 Lawrence E. Rosen. All rights
 reserved. Permission is hereby granted to copy and distribute this
 license without modification. This license may not be modified without
 the express written permission of its copyright owner.
