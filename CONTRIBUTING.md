# How to contribute

Thanks for wanting to contribute! Every small help is meaningful!

Before starting an issue or a pull request, please check that it doesn't already exist.

You can either:
- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/Elanis/web-to-desktop-framework-comparison/issues/new) on the repository
- Fork the project, edit it, and create a pull request on this repository

# What "rules" should I follow while contributing?

Well, there are not many rules:
- If you want to add a new benchmark, follow the already existing directory structure
```
benchmark/
  application-type/
    framework-name/
      => Your example here
runner/
  => Runner files for the automated benchmarks
```
- If you want to fix an issue, simply edit the file(s) and make a pull request
